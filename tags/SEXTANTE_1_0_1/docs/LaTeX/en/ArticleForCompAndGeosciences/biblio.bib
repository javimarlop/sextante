	is becoming a confluence of collaborative interactions, negotiations
	and planning platforms. The integration of Web services with Geographic
	Information Systems {(GIS)} has triggered a new wave of interest
	for using the Web to compose dynamic mapping services for environmental
	planning. Web services could offer a framework for service integration
	and composition for collaborative environmental modeling. By wrapping
	geo-processing services of interoperable standards of {XML} and {SOAP,}
	we demonstrate a prototype implementation of environmental decision
	support systems {GEO-} {ELCA} {(Exploratory} Land Use Change Analysis)
	where Web service-enabled middleware adds core functionality to a
	Web mapping service. The system demonstrates how geo-processing services
	can be integrated with environmental simulation models using {OGC}
	{(Open} {GIS} Consortium) compliant connectors that support {WMS}

  abstract = {The development of virtual maps on the internet {(Geoweb} or Geospatial
	Web) in the last few years has experienced an exceptional boom which
	has yet to reach its peak. New technologies have enabled the creation
	of Geowebs through which information is delivered to users; the quantity
	and type of geoweb information delivered are increasing daily. The
	visualization of the planet through Geoweb applications and web pages
	has become a major force in increasing the importance of geographical
	and positional information. As the Geoweb is extremely easy to use,
	the number of users today is in the hundreds of millions. Therefore
	it can be said that the Geoweb has become a cultural phenomenon.
	The next phase in the development of the Geoweb is expected to be
	in the areas of incorporating {GIS} {(Geographic} Information System)
	into the Geoweb and the reverse, and in developing new delivery systems
	for the Geoweb, on fixed and mobile internet platforms. Further development
	of the Geoweb in Croatia depends on a number of parameters. For this
	reason, further development is presented in this thesis in four dimensions
	these being the informational, technological, cultural and business.
	Anybody considering becoming a publisher of Geoweb content should
	consider these four dimensions when planning their developmental
	strategy, to enhance their chances of success. The Geoweb is definitely
	here to stay. It will continue to expand in terms of the volume of
	information delivery and the range and capabilities of the delivery
	systems.},
